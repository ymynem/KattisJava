# KattisJavaOrCPP
The description of the problems can be found in: https://open.kattis.com.
The name of each class corresponds to the name of the problems at kattis.
I am doing this at my freetime, I first solve the problems
using Java or CPP and then trying to do it in Ruby because I am learning to code in Ruby.
